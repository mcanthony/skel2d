- strip down gfx.js to just what is needed
- make webgl renderer
- implement slots and slots animations
- implement attachments
- figure out how to do shape attachments (splines, rectangles, circles, etc)
- figure out how to import images from computer (drop a folder? maybe a zip)
x path: add fill without stroke (just flatten and add points to vbo)
x path: check if point equals previous one when pushing points
x path: check if first and last points are equal when shape is closed
x timeline val_flip
x load skeleton and animations from data object
x test flipping, it's probably fucked up too
