- default bone color
- parser: animations/timelines
- parser: skins
- parser: draw order
- editor: syntax highlighting
- core: add more easing functions
- renderer: add sprite rendering
- figure out how to import images from computer (drop a folder? maybe a zip)
- renderer optimization: static shapes can be stroked only once, then just transform vertices

x parser timeline commands: make easing a number that indexes some array
x check ace key bindings and remove useless crap (like ctrl+, for settings)
x always check that first path command is M (added in core loader)
x tokenizer: ending \ on start and skeleton states
x tokenizer: path commands
x renderer: shape anchor at center
x renderer: improve bone rendering so bones with no length are visible
x renderer/core: add bone colors
x renderer/core: add miter limit
x parser: border_radius shortcut in rect attachment
x parser: create implicit parent bones
x test slot animations
x test attachment transform on paths.. what i did is probably not useful. better if the transform
  is applied relative to the main bone
x implement attachments
x figure out how to do shape attachments (splines, rectangles, circles, etc)
x make webgl renderer
x strip down gfx.js to just what is needed
x path: add fill without stroke (just flatten and add points to vbo)
x path: check if point equals previous one when pushing points
x path: check if first and last points are equal when shape is closed
x implement slots and slots animations
x timeline val_flip
x load skeleton and animations from data object
x test flipping, it's probably fucked up too
