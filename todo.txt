- implement slots and slots animations
- implement attachments
- figure out how to do shape attachments (splines, rectangles, circles, etc)
- figure out how to import images from computer (drop a folder?)
x timeline val_flip
x load skeleton and animations from data object
x test flipping, it's probably fucked up too
