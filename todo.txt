- add sprite rendering
- test slot animations
- figure out how to import images from computer (drop a folder? maybe a zip)
x test attachment transform on paths.. what i did is probably not useful. better if the transform
  is applied relative to the main bone
x implement attachments
x figure out how to do shape attachments (splines, rectangles, circles, etc)
x make webgl renderer
x strip down gfx.js to just what is needed
x path: add fill without stroke (just flatten and add points to vbo)
x path: check if point equals previous one when pushing points
x path: check if first and last points are equal when shape is closed
x implement slots and slots animations
x timeline val_flip
x load skeleton and animations from data object
x test flipping, it's probably fucked up too
